Travel Agency Management Project.

Built a fully normalized Travel Agency Database from scratch with multiple meaningful relationships between various entities, using Oracle with PHP.Wrote queries in MySQL and implemented a GUI through which the user can easily store, manage, and retrieve useful data related to their booking with the Agency.

Utilizes knowledge of SQL, PHP, Oracle, Data Normalization, Relational Databases.                                    

For this project I used UBC’s CPSC department’s Oracle database system with PHP.
